			<h2>Color maps</h2>
			<h3>Continuous color maps</h3>
			<p>
				Finding a color map for scientific visualization that looks aesthetically in color print, is black-and-white safe, and does not introduce artifacts in the plotted data is a non-trivial task. 
				Fortunately, this question has already been addressed, for instance in the following publications:

				<li>
					Kenneth Moreland, <i>Why We Use Bad Color Maps and What You Can Do About It.</i><br />
					Proceedings of Human Vision and Electronic Imaging <b>133</b>, 1 (2016).<br />

				On his website, Kenneth Moreland provides his articles, supplemental material, and links to related websites. 
				Most importantly, you can download a collection of different color maps there, which can easily be imported in scientific plotting programs like <a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/">gnuplot</a>. 
			</p>
			<h3>Discrete color maps</h3>
			If you are just searching for a collection of different colors that fit nicely to one another, e.g. in order to color different graphs in a 2D plot, you may have a look at:
			<ul>
				<li>
					A collection of gnuplot palettes available on <a href="https://github.com/Gnuplotting/gnuplot-palettes">github</a>. There you will also find a picture that gives you a quick overview over the different palettes. 
				</li>
				<li>
					A nice tool to identify and export colors: <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">colorbrewer</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Adobe color wheel: <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">color wheel</a>.

			<h2>LaTeX beamer template</h2>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, the University of Basel does not provide templates for presentations using the LaTeX beamer package. 
				This <a href="unibas_beamer.zip">.zip archive</a> contains my personal LaTeX presentation template that can be configured according to your needs. 
				This <a href="presentation.pdf">introductory sample presentation</a> gives you a glimpse on the possibilities of the template. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The template mimicks the corporate design of PowerPoint presentations of the University of Basel. 
				The main colors of the corporate design are already predefined. 
				For legal reasons, I did not include the University logo. 
				However, you can download it <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/de/Mitarbeitendenportal/Infrastruktur/Corporate-Design/Logo-Vorlagen.html">here</a> if you are a member of the University.
			</p>
			<p>
				A modified version of the template which is adjusted to the corporate design of the University of Chicago can be found <a href="uchicago_beamer.zip">here</a>.
				Again, you can download the University logo <a href="https://pme.uchicago.edu/about/logo-and-templates">here</a> if you are a member of the University.

			<h2>LaTeX poster template</h2>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, the University of Basel does not provide templates for scientific posters in LaTeX format. 
				This <a href="unibas_poster.zip">.zip archive</a> contains my personal LaTeX poster template that can be configured in many ways according to your needs. 
				This <a href="poster.pdf">introductory sample poster</a> gives you a glimpse on the possibilities of the template. 
				Except for minor adjustments, the template is mainly based on the <a href="http://www.brian-amberg.de/uni/poster/">baposter</a> package by <a href="http://www.brian-amberg.de/">Brian Amberg</a> and Reinhold Kalkhofer. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The main colors of the corporate design of the University of Basel are already predefined in the template. 
				For legal reasons, I did not include the University logo. 
				However, it can be downloaded <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/de/Mitarbeitendenportal/Infrastruktur/Corporate-Design/Logo-Vorlagen.html">here</a> if you are a member of the University. 
			</p>
			<p>
			If you are a member of <a href="http://www.nccr-qsit.ethz.ch/">NCCR QSIT</a>, you may also use this package to create posters in the QSIT corporate design, since the QSIT background is already predefined. 
				Again, the QSIT logo is not included.

			<h2>PDF to X3 conversion for linux</h2>
			<p>
				Scientific posters can be printed at the <a href="https://its.unibas.ch/">University of Basel IT services</a>. 
				They accept only PDF files that satisfy the PDF-X3 standard in order to ensure a successful printing process. 
				However, if you use a presentation application or <a href="http://tug.org/texlive/">TeX</a> to create your poster, these programs may not be able to export a PDF-X3 file directly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A possible way to generate PDF-X3 files is to use commercial applications that allow you to save a PDF directly to the required format. 
				Another way for <a href="https://www.linux.org/">linux</a> users is to use a combination of <a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/">ghostscript</a> and <a href="https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/">pdftk</a> to convert a PDF file to PDF-X3. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The following <a href="linux_PDF_X3_conversion.zip">.zip archive</a> contains a shell script that performs all the necessary steps for you. 
				Except for minor changes and a bugfix, it is mostly based on a script written by <a href="http://ultracold.org/menu/">Axel Lode</a>. 
				To use it, unpack the .tar archive and install the packages ghostscript and pdftk using the package manager of your linux distribution. 
				Type <i>./poster_convert.sh Name_of_the_poster.pdf</i> and wait until a file <i>Ready_to_print_X3_Name_of_the_poster.pdf</i> has been generated. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Technical notes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						The University of Basel IT services accept only files produced by ghostscript 9.10 (that's why there is a warning if you have other versions), but ghostscript versions 9.18 and 9.25 should also work.
					</li>
					<li>
						The script first removes some bugs in PDF files created by Apple applications, converts the PDF to X3 standard using ghostscript, and finally sets the creator/producer information in the PDF metadata to ghostscript 9.10 (irrespective of which ghostscript version you actually used) to ensure that the PDF file is accepted by the IT services.

			<h2>Adobe Reader Error 131</h2>
			<p>
			Older versions of Adobe Reader are not able to open some PDF presentations generated using LaTeX beamer and display an error message <i>There was a problem reading this document (131)</i>. 
				This issue can be fixed by re-encoding the PDF using <a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/">ghostscript</a>. 
				Assuming your presentation is called <tt>faulty_presentation.pdf</tt>, simply type the following command in a terminal:
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>
					gs -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE  -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=reencrypted_presentation.pdf faulty_presentation.pdf
